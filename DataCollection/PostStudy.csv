2022/05/19 7:21:59 PM MDT,51,The last task where I had to input numbers or letters into a keyboard. This was the easiest task because it was simply imputing basic information into a textbox.  ,Using Mode A would have to be the most difficult because it involved the most attention. It divided my attention between multiple stimuli and made it more difficult to focus compared to Mode A or the last task. My eyes had to attend to more stimuli on screen which made it more difficult compared to Mode B or the last task where my attention was only on a single task.  ,"Using my thumb and index finger to select things felt confusing. I understand you need a way to select things from far away without having to walk to it. But I think there could be a more simpler way of doing this as it doesn't always register the index finger and thumb motion. The interface was really huge at times and really small at other times. More example, I opened up the atlas and the Earth spawned inside of me, while I opened up the code thingy and at times it would appear in random spots. The location and size of the objects felt inconsistent.    ","When the application was small, the content was not always easy to read.  Though it could just be my eyesight the resolution of the wording felt blurry at times. It also has to do with the fact that the small font made it difficult to read. ",Yes,I think that as the size changed the code would appear ? I might has looked at an object with no code but then kept walking towards it and as it got larger suddenly a red code appeared. ,I would try and reserve a bigger room with more objects maybe. Other than that I think the experiment is ran very well.  ,4,3,2,2,2,5,2,3,2,7
